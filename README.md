* Project:COMPUTER VISION TASK
* Objective: Computer Vision is a subfield of AI that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the real world. This task involves
  working on a computer vision problem, such as image classification or object detection.
# Key activities
* Object detection: Uses neural networks to localize and classify objects in images
# Technologies used
* python: Primary programming language used for solving computer vision task
* numpy: Used for working with arrays and contains functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices
* cv2: Provides developers with an easy-to-use interface for working with image and video processing functions
* Colab: Colab is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources
